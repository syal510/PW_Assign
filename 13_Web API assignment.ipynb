    "API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is used to connect different software applications  to seamlessly interact with each otherand request and exchange information. It enables the integration of different software systems. E.g. Weather API from OpenWeatherMap is used to fetch the weather data from the servers by an external application. This data is sent by the weather api in json or xml format back to where the request was generated."
